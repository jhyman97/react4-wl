                <h2>Saahil Yerkola</h2>
                <p>Saahil Yerkola, a finance student at the University of North Carolina, has been deeply
                    immersed in
                    the sneaker community for years. With strong connections to local Raleigh store owners,
                    Saahil has
                    successfully tapped into a wide customer base through multiple consignment stores, as well
                    as
                    partnerships with bulk sellers, allowing him to efficiently move large volumes of products.
                    Despite
                    the fluctuations in the sneaker market, Saahil has consistently found ways to stay
                    profitable and
                    grow his business. Now, he's taking his expertise and extensive inventory online, aiming to
                    build a
                    one-stop shop for sneaker enthusiasts
