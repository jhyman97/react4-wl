                <h2>Why we started</h2>
                <p>We started this business with the same drive that fuels most entrepreneurs: a passion for the
                    product and
                    the potential for success. At just 16, we believed that with determination, we could make a big
                    impact.
                    Back then, consignment stores were charging around 10% fees and offering prices at or below
                    market
                    value. However, over time, many of these stores became greedy, hiking their fees to 15-18% and
                    significantly inflating prices. Frustrated by this greed and the negative effect it had on the
                    sneaker
                    community, we decided to create a platform that prioritizes fair pricing, authentic sneakers,
                    and
                    exceptional customer service.
